The TXRA will award up to two $500 scholarships to outstanding Texas Junior players who will play in the 2019 Junior Nationals. To qualify for the scholarship, the following guidelines are set forth:
</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled list-icons">
<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>The player must play in the 2019 Texas State Juniors tournament,

<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>The player must have 2 recommendations from a credible adult, such as a teacher, coach, etc. (cannot be a parent or other relation),

<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> The scholarships are not needs based, they are merit based. They are scholarships, not reimbursements, and

<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i>The player must submit a short essay on why they are deserving of the scholarship.
</ul>
<p>
Applications must be submitted by April 1, 2019, for consideration by the Board, and will be awarded at the Regional tournament in San Antonio.
